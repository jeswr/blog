[Doc Searls' intention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy) talks about the idea of sending a "signal into the market" describing to a market what you want.

Some claim that this vision formed some of the initial inspiration to develop [Solid](https://solidproject.org).

This post is me sending a signal to the world describing the things I would like to see built that would improve my life.

## Something is wrong - go fix it

I've had a fair share of health issues over the last year.

For instance, I have the following allergens and intolerances:
 - Gluten (coeliac)
 - Lactose
 - Sulphites
 - Nuts (at least peanuts and hazelnuts, rest tbd)
 - Pesticides(?) ... or something else that appears to be on some fruits such as grapes ...

I was also taking [GluteGuard](https://gluteguard.com.au) to try and cope with trace elements of gluten that might pop up in meals when I went out ... funny thing, it turned out the GluteGuard contained sulphites and I spent the better past of the last year in a state where my brain was barely functioning.

The funny thing about being in that state; is that you'll tend to not realise, or be in denial, about there being a problem in the first place - which in turn means I wasn't trying to resolve the issue anywhere near as actively as I could/should have been.

Advertisers already heavily track minute interactions, how long we spend on particular posts, our reaction time, which links we click on etc. in order to do targeted advertising. I want that same infrastructure to tell me when something is ... off; so that I am validated to go and fix it.
