Infrastructure projects rightfully require [Environmental Impact Assessments](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/environmental-impact-assessment) so that potential harms to the environment are identified - before determining whether infrastructure projects may proceeed.

Increasingly, it would seem there is a need for an equivalent for both physical and digital infrastructure - given the increase in, e.g., [online harms](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper).

[This](https://www.iaia.org/wiki-details.php?ID=23) is the first result that comes up when searching the term "Social Impact Assessment" on Google - so it seems these kinds of ideas have been circulating at least in the space of assessing e.g., policy interventions; but less so it seems for digital infrastructure.
