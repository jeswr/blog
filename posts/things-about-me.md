## Enjoying life

The older I get, the more I want to enjoy life.

## I like summers

I used to like winters more because I could be cozy by a fireplace. Having spent the last 2 years in consistent winter weather because of the paths that I have taken in my travels - I now realize I really like the sun, and spring. In an ideal, I would follow spring around the world.

## I have self-destructive habits that crop up when my brain chemistry is off

Especially if due to having consumed one of my allergens - which puts me in a depressive date, I won't want to exercise, I'll sit in awkward positions which puts my skeletal system out of shape, I'll stare at a screen trying to get work done, but ultimately just get distracted by side tasks.

## I get stuck in cycles and struggle to get out

Not taking one weekend, turns into not taking 10. Because after not taking one I work slowly, which means I need to catch up on the next weekend ... and I let the cycle continue.

## I people please

I always want to make everyone happy. This is impossible, and I need to make sure to put myself first more.
