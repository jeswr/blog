    </header>
    <p>In this post I set out the interface that I would like to have in order to get more value out of language models for tasks such as research that require high levels of information accuracy and provenance. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicate the likelihood of correctness of statements in a response via color coding of the text. This color coding should be personalisable based on whether I:</li>
<li>confirm whether entities in a sentence are the ones I want to talk about</li>
<li>confirm that I trust information sources from which the answer was derived</li>
<li>confirm further background questions that the model has if I ask it to "improve its certainty"</li>
<li>Hyperlinking entities (things such as people, places, objects etc.) in a response, so I can confirm that this is the entity I care about. If I hover over the hyperlink I should be able to see extra information about the entity, such as a picture, full name and other key details and have the option to say "this is not what I'm after" or hit a green check mark in the top right corner to allow the interface to update its accuracy color-codings.</li>
</ul>

<p>This example has been produced using generative AI can be found <a href="/ltcm">here</a>. Note only the bottom popup example works at the moment.</p>
<p>This requires advancements beyond current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a> and emergent <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/large-concept-models-language-modeling-in-a-sentence-representation-space/">Large Concept Models (LCMs)</a> architectures. In particular, this would require models to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have in-built mechanisms for entity resolution</li>
<li>Have knowledge of the provenance trails of the information it has learned</li>
<li>Discern - from information such as these provenance trails - between <em>ideas</em> and <em>proven results</em>/<em>observations</em> in order to be able to accurately frame what is ground truth and what is conjecture that may or may not have consensus amongst a large group of people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am interested in developing architectures that are in support of this vision.</p>
