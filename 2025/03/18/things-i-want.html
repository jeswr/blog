<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intention_Economy">Doc Searls' intention economy</a> talks about the idea of sending a "signal into the market" describing to a market what you want.</p>
<p>Some claim that this vision formed some of the initial inspiration to develop <a href="https://solidproject.org">Solid</a>.</p>
<p>This post is me sending a signal to the world describing the things I would like to see built that would improve my life.</p>
<h2 id="somethingiswronggofixit">Something is wrong - go fix it</h2>
<p>I've had a fair share of health issues over the last year.</p>
<p>For instance, I have the following allergens and intolerances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gluten (coeliac)</li>
<li>Lactose</li>
<li>Sulphites</li>
<li>Nuts (at least peanuts and hazelnuts, rest tbd)</li>
<li>Pesticides(?) … or something else that appears to be on some fruits such as grapes …</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also taking <a href="https://gluteguard.com.au">GluteGuard</a> to try and cope with trace elements of gluten that might pop up in meals when I went out … funny thing, it turned out the GluteGuard contained sulphites and I spent the better past of the last year in a state where my brain was barely functioning.</p>
<p>The funny thing about being in that state; is that you'll tend to not realise, or be in denial, about there being a problem in the first place - which in turn means I wasn't trying to resolve the issue anywhere near as actively as I could/should have been.</p>
<p>Advertisers already heavily track minute interactions, how long we spend on particular posts, our reaction time, which links we click on etc. in order to do targeted advertising. I want that same infrastructure to tell me when something is … off; so that I am validated to go and fix it.</p>
<h2 id="abalancednewsfeed">A balanced news feed</h2>
<p>For engagement, most news feeds are weighted to have many alarming or unique stories; whilst less exciting and ongoing things get ignored. An example given in <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/453652/not-the-end-of-the-world-by-ritchie-hannah/9781529931242">not the end of the world</a> is the minimal reporting on improvements in renewable technologies in comparison to climate disasters. I want a news feed with an algorithm that is ranked somehow highest impact changes - than most alarmist / engaging.</p>
