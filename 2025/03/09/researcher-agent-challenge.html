    <p><i>Draft / mood-post-written-in-10-minutes</i></p>

<p>I've spent the last few days using <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/">OpenAI's Deep Research agent</a> with ChatGPT 4.5. I'm quite impressed with the results it produces; and definitely reduces what would have previously been a few hours of browsing - to a 10-minute coffee break whilst I wait for the Researcher Agent to do its thing.</p>
<p>At the same time - it exacerbates the following challenges of doing research on the Web:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most advertised information is that which features in the result; but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the <em>best</em> or most <em>factually correct</em> information</li>
<li>Unrelated information creeps in under the guise of an answer to the query. A good example of where I saw this is in <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67cdaacf-5728-800c-ac59-137d7d1aeec9">this discussion of Verifiable Credentials</a> where the model included a lengthy discussion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity"><em>self sovereign identity</em></a> and public key infrastructure such as <a href="https://keri.one"><em>KERI</em></a>. Whilst this often infrastructure often appears in solution architectures with Verifiable Credentials - it was certainly not appropriate to have an entry for <em>KERI</em> in a table comparing different Verifiable Credential Standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>I expect (hope) we will see a number of iterative improvements over the next view months to try and:</p>
<ul>
<li>where applicable, prioritize academic / authorotative sources; such as those found on Google Scholar and standards documents</li>
<li>filter out "derived sources"; for instance blog posts and news articles that are just summarizing an article or publication that the model can access</li>
<li>filter out sources generated by GenAI</li>
</ul>
<p>As I briefly touched upon in <a href="/2024/04/25/raw-data-now/">this post</a>; my view is that we can go <em>much further</em> than this by curating a Web of precise and trusted data - where possible using formal semantics, such as in a (RDF) Knowledge Graph. This seems sound given that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphrag is still increasing popularity for grounding models; including to ground Gemini's answers in google queries, and</li>
<li>LLMs are getting better at supporting text to structured data conversions</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond soundness - a couple of reasons this is <em>necessary</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>We can be clearer about the <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/186094848?h=87a4e916e7">semantic commitments</a> we're making, and</li>
<li>We can search for data rather than pages</li>
</ul>
