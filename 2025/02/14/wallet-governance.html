<p>We are about to create another cookie problem :cookie: - with Digital Credentials in Data Wallets.</p>
<p>My previous article on <a href="/2025/02/14/data-wallets/">Data Wallets</a> discussed what Verifiable Credentials were - and where they fit into regulatory frameworks such as eIDAS in Europe and the proposed Digital Verification Scheme (DVS) in the UK. </p>
<p>Such credentials can contain sensitive personal information, that often requires the <em>verifier</em> to establish a legal basis upon which they can process the data - such as user consent. Within the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Specification</a> this is recognized, and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#terms-of-use"><code>termsOfUse</code></a> entry is supported to support in precisely describing the <em>permissions</em> (e.g. Service Personalization) for which data may be used, what usage of data within the credential is <em>prohibited</em> (e.g. Marketing) and any <em>obligations</em> that must be met when using the data (e.g. report any 3rd parties this data is shared with). The formal language often used to describe these <em>permissions</em>, <em>prohibitions</em> and <em>obligations</em> is known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)</a>.</p>
<p>However, without the legal infrastructure to recognize the inclusion of this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#terms-of-use"><code>termsOfUse</code></a> entry as a valid way of <em>creating</em> a legal basis for data processing - such as being a valid way of proving consent; this entry is relegated to merely being a descriptor of the basis' for processing that have already been established. How are these bases' established? Likely, the mechanism that we know and love - a pop-up consent box, every time you use the credential<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>!</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://blog.jeswr.org/2025/02/14/data-wallets#datauseandaccessbill">my previous article</a> the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-identity">Digital Verification Scheme</a> is proposed within the UK's <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825/">Data (use and access) Bill</a>. The DVS provides a mechanism for the Secretary of State to create a list of certified service providers to provide services related to credential issuance, management and verification.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">Digital Identity and Attributes Framework (DIATF)</a> is a framework that explicitly describes the different types of service providers that can be implemented under the DVS - including technical roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>If we are specifically talking about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">Digital Identity and Attributes Framework (DIATF)</a> in the UK, it could take the form of terms of use term within <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#terms-of-use">Verifiable Credentials</a>. Specifically in the context of DIATF what regulators could do is state that when a Verifiable Credential is sent from a Holder:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Holder is legally obliged to use pre-defined user preferences or ask directly from the user, the privacy terms they wish to apply to the data. These would likely be described as a set of permissions, obligations, and prohibitions within an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">ODRL Rule</a></li>
<li>The service receiving the data is legally obliged to adhere to the stated privacy preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p>In most cases - the rules would largely enumerate the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/dpv/2.0/dpv/">DPV Purposes</a> for which the user consents their data to be used.</p>

    <li id="fn1">This is a little exaggerated since data processing for <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/">legitimate interests</a> does not require such a flow. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></li>
