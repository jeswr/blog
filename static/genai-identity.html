    <h1><a id="top" href="#top">Comparative Analysis of Digital Identity Architectures</a></h1>

    <h2><a id="introduction" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>Digital identity architectures have evolved from siloed, centralized systems to more federated and decentralized models in pursuit of greater security, user control, and interoperability. This report compares major identity paradigms – centralized identity (e.g. enterprise directories using LDAP or SAML-based SSO), federated identity (e.g. OAuth2/OpenID Connect social login), decentralized identity (e.g. W3C Decentralized Identifiers or DIDs), self-sovereign identity (SSI frameworks like Sovrin or Microsoft ION), the new Federated Credential Management (FedCM) web API, and other emerging hybrid models. We analyze how each addresses key requirements such as privacy, trust, user agency, interoperability, selective disclosure, etc., and examine use cases driving their adoption – from simple login and KYC compliance to government IDs, verifiable credentials, and autonomous agent delegation. The findings are related to broader goals of digital/data sovereignty, delegated trust, and dynamic agent-based interactions in a decentralized ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of trust, provenance, and user control in future identity infrastructures.</p>

    <h2><a id="overview" href="#overview">Overview of Identity Architecture Models</a></h2>
    <p>Illustration of identity models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(top-left) Centralized identity (each service issues its own user identity)</li>
        <li>(top-right) "Open trust" federated identity (one Identity Provider login gives access to multiple services)</li>
        <li>(bottom-left) Federated trust network (multiple IdPs in a trust federation)</li>
        <li>(bottom-right) Self-Sovereign Identity (user holds a digital ID/credentials to authenticate to services directly)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="centralized" href="#centralized">Centralized Identity Systems (LDAP, SAML, etc.)</a></h2>
    <p>In a centralized identity model, a single authority or service provider governs identity data and authentication. Examples include corporate directory services like LDAP/Active Directory and proprietary login systems for individual websites. Users register an account (username, password, attributes) with the provider, which then acts as the sole source of truth for that identity. This is analogous to each website or organization issuing its own "identity wristband" – convenient within that domain but not recognized elsewhere.</p>

    <h2><a id="federated" href="#federated">Federated Identity (OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML SSO)</a></h2>
    <p>Federated identity management links identities across multiple domains via trusted third-party Identity Providers (IdPs). Instead of each service maintaining a separate login, a user can authenticate through a common IdP (like Google, Facebook, or an enterprise SSO server) and then access various relying party services.</p>

    <h2><a id="decentralized" href="#decentralized">Decentralized Identity (DIDs and Verifiable Credentials)</a></h2>
    <p>Decentralized identity represents a shift to user-controlled, distributed identity management without a central issuing authority. The core standard is the Decentralized Identifier (DID), a globally unique identifier (like did:example:1234...) that is registered on a distributed ledger or blockchain or derived via cryptographic algorithms.</p>

    <h2><a id="ssi" href="#ssi">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI Frameworks e.g. Sovrin, ION)</a></h2>
    <p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a specific vision of decentralized identity with an emphasis on full user control, portability, and lifetime persistent identity. In practice, SSI frameworks provide the infrastructure and governance rules to make decentralized identity work at scale.</p>

    <h2><a id="fedcm" href="#fedcm">Federated Credential Management (FedCM) – Privacy-Oriented Federated Login</a></h2>
    <p>FedCM (Federated Credential Management) is a recent web API initiative (spearheaded by Google's Privacy Sandbox) to modernize federated login in browsers in a more privacy-preserving way.</p>

    <h2><a id="hybrid" href="#hybrid">Emerging and Hybrid Identity Models</a></h2>
    <p>Beyond the above, several hybrid approaches are developing to bridge centralized, federated, and decentralized paradigms.</p>

    <p class="matrix-note">Table 1. Qualitative assessment of how different identity architectures support key requirements and values (✓ = supports well, ~ = partially, ✕ = weak/absent). The assessments are relative: e.g. "High" means the architecture inherently enables that requirement strongly, whereas "Low" means it has inherent limitations in that area.</p>

    <h2><a id="use-cases" href="#use-cases">Use Cases and Drivers for Adoption of Each Architecture</a></h2>
    <p>Digital identity architectures have been driven by different use cases and requirements over time. Below, we overview the scenarios in which each model thrives, and the technical/social drivers behind their development:</p>

    <h3><a id="general-purpose" href="#general-purpose">General-Purpose Identity (Login, Authentication & SSO)</a></h3>
    <p>Basic login authentication is the foundational use case. Centralized identity (username/password per site) was the first solution – easy to implement for service providers but burdensome for users (many passwords) and risky (password reuse, breaches).</p>

    <h3><a id="kyc" href="#kyc">Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Identity Verification</a></h3>
    <p>KYC and identity verification for compliance (e.g. opening a bank account, verifying age for a purchase, customer due diligence in finance) are major drivers for advanced identity solutions.</p>

    <h3><a id="government" href="#government">Government IDs and Public Services</a></h3>
    <p>Government-issued identity (e.g. national ID, driver's license, passport) is undergoing a digital transformation.</p>

    <h3><a id="industry" href="#industry">Verifiable Credentials in Industry (Education, Healthcare, Workforce)</a></h3>
    <p>Beyond government, many industries are embracing verifiable credentials to solve long-standing issues with credentials and certifications.</p>

    <h3><a id="ai-iot" href="#ai-iot">Data Minimization for AI Agents and IoT (Agentic Delegation)</a></h3>
    <p>As we move toward an environment of ubiquitous AI assistants and IoT devices acting on our behalf, the identity requirements become more complex.</p>

    <h3><a id="delegated-trust" href="#delegated-trust">Delegated Trust and Agent Autonomy</a></h3>
    <p>The concept of delegated trust is exemplified in these cases: trust is not only between a user and a service, but can be transitively delegated – e.g. user trusts agent, agent interacts with service; or manufacturer trusts device identity, device authenticates to service.</p>

    <h2><a id="summary" href="#summary">Summary of Use Case Drivers</a></h2>
    <p>In summary, centralized identity systems were driven by the need for simple account management within a domain, and still suffice for isolated contexts or when full control by a provider is required.</p>

    <h2><a id="future" href="#future">Toward Digital Sovereignty, Delegated Trust, and Agent-Based Ecosystems</a></h2>
    <p>A unifying theme across these developments is the pursuit of digital sovereignty – empowering individuals, organizations, and even nations with greater control over digital interactions.</p>

    <h3><a id="pillars" href="#pillars">Trust, Provenance, and Control</a></h3>
    <p>Trust, provenance, and control are indeed the pillars for future interoperable agent-based infrastructure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> achieved through cryptographic verification and shared trust registries, rather than blind trust in centralized authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Provenance:</strong> every identity claim or piece of data can carry metadata of its origin (who issued it, when, under what conditions).</li>
        <li><strong>Control:</strong> refers to both user control over personal identity data and system control (governance) over the identity ecosystem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="conclusion" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
    <p>In conclusion, the trajectory of identity architectures is toward greater decentralization of trust and greater centralization of user control. Centralized and federated systems solved yesterday's problems of convenience and basic interoperability, but decentralized and SSI models are solving the emerging requirements of user empowerment, privacy, and machine-scale trust.</p>

    <p class="source-note">Sources: The analysis above is informed by current literature and standards in the digital identity field, including industry reports and standards documentation for centralized vs. decentralized identity, technical blogs on federated vs. SSI models, official discussions on the FedCM API, and use-case driven reports on SSI for KYC and privacy compliance, among others. These sources collectively illustrate the evolution of identity architectures and their relative alignment with key requirements in the digital identity ecosystem.</p>
