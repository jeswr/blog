## TOS Overview

This report defines our research project, designed to progress the development of Semi-autonomous agents at Web scale. We are considering neurosymbolic systems which 


Through our work, we are working towards a near-term future in which legal entities, such as individuals and organisations can entrust semi-autonomous AI-driven agents to carry out online interactions on their behalf. Our research concerns the development of semi-autonomous Web agents, which consult users if and only if the system does not have sufficient context or confidence to proceed working autonomously. This creates a user-agent dialogue that allows the user to teach the agent about the information sources they trust, their data-sharing preferences, and their decision-making preferences. Ultimately, this enables the user to maximise control over their data and decisions while retaining the convenience of using agents, including those driven by LLMs.
In view of developing near-term solutions, the research seeks to answer the overarching question: “How do we build a trustworthy and reliable network of semi-autonomous agents which represent individuals and organisations on the Web?”. After identifying key requirements, the paper presents a demo for a sample use case of a generic personal assistant. This is implemented using (Notation3) rules to enforce safety guarantees around belief, data sharing and data usage and LLMs to allow natural language interaction with users and serendipitous dialogues between software agents.

## TOS Methodologies

### Methodologies
In this section we summarise the methodologies that we shall be applying to answer a range of questions throughout our thesis.

Random quotes:
Clive Humby, a business intelligence technology pioneer in the UK, and founder of the Tesco
(national, household-name, UK supermarket chain) Clubcard loyalty scheme, famously spoke of data as the
‘New Oil’, and noted in the same presentation that, “without context a fact is just that: A fact. It is not an
insight” [96.]

In a 2021 paper, IBM® conceived of “data objects”. These were defined as: “the information or data
owned within the scope of ownership” [1o2.] This introduced concepts of ownership of data, of their
stewardship and custodianship, but also of a bounding of ownership, a domain or scope.

### Ontology Design
Modelling Identity and Identity flows
Model, for instance, all of the concepts from OpenID and demonstrate how you can develop OpenID equivalent flows by having systems declaratively write their security assumptions – rather than hard coding the flows. The goal is to make it easy to support a range of identity and authentication flows (including with SSI, OpenID, Passkey etc. infrastructure), and to declaratively model e.g. concepts from the DIATF.

Need to dig back out a systematic review of identity like the following to get that working

### User Interaction Design

### Speculative Design

### Complexity Analysis of Selective Disclosure Query

## User studies with Legal Scholars for ODRL Generation work

Topics to cover:

Jun:
 - User studies, set of scenarios to legal experts - please tell me what legal structures are necessary. Then do a follow up study to say "Hi I designed this, what do you think".
- Individuals vs. organisatons, (commercial | non-commercial) organisations w. (commercial | non-commercial) organisation,
- More rigorous is x2 criticalness
- Within the 6 then say half of them is life critical and half is not
- Another way is to look into the literature to see what has been discussed and what has not

## Understanding the future that people want
What if we dropped all assumptions, we have about what technology has to look like, and instead start to think about what we want technology to look like. Visionaries such as [] are always leading the charge to build the future that they envision, the future that they want. But what does everyone else want? Do they even know?
In this set of research, inspired by David Hyland-Wood, we shall 

Study design:
-	First ask a broad set of questions about what people want the future of technology to look like, no prompting around data centralisation around the user, disruption of monopolistic power, or otherwise swaying the response in that manner
-	Then start to unpack what is possible / provide more inspiration
