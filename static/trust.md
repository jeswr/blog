## Trust

I did a substantial amount of work on the topic of trust models last year, but am unlikely to pick it up or publish on the topic in the near future. As such, I would like to provide pointers to those who have been asking about the topic and wish to pick it up.

Existing research:
 - The best places to look in terms of existing work are:
   - The [reference ontology of trust](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-33246-4_1), which is based upon the [universal foundation ontologies](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-125/paper2.pdf). UFO is on the track towards full ISO accreditation - I learned this information at a recent talk by [Giancarlo Guizzardi](https://www.giancarloguizzardi.com)[^1] - but I am struggling to find this information on the Web.

[^1]: As an aside, I highly recommend watching [some of his talks](https://www.giancarloguizzardi.com/interviews) and appreciate his sentiment that "there is no such thing as 'no ontology design' in computing, just bad ontology design"
